# User Experience Focus

- Abstract Away Complexity: Build wallets that abstract away complexities like gas fees and intricate wallet management for users.
- Enable User-Friendly Features: Implement features like one-click transactions, familiar recovery methods, and onboarding flows that don't require managing gas or specific tokens.
- Consider Gasless Transactions: Utilize paymasters to enable gas abstraction, allowing users to pay transaction fees in ERC-20 tokens or have fees sponsored.
- Optimize for DeFi Use Cases: For DeFi platforms, enable the approval and execution of multiple transactions in one step to reduce complexity and gas costs.
- Ensure Performance in Multi-Chain Apps: For multi-chain dApps, prioritize rapid transaction execution, system reliability, and consistent high performance to maintain user trust and engagement.
