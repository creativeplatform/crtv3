# Security Best Practices

- Prioritize Secure Smart Contract Development: Implementing smart contract wallets requires a deep understanding of secure smart contract development. Poorly designed contracts can lead to fund loss or wallet lockouts.
- Conduct Thorough Audits: Smart contract wallets must be carefully audited to avoid exploits. Regular audits should be considered to maintain trust and safety.
- Implement Robust Recovery Mechanisms: Design customizable authentication methods and recovery options to reduce the risk of key loss or theft. Ensure recovery mechanisms are robust without compromising user security.
- Be Aware of Multi-Chain Security Risks: When building multi-chain dApps, recognize the elevated risk of attacks due to interactions with multiple blockchains and potential disparities in security protocols.
